  Structure debate notes into evidence-based Socratic Arguments: definitions,
  supporting clauses, main argument, steelman refutations, and rebuttals.
  Use when the user shares opponent quotes, a position blob, asks to think
  socratically, or wants a durable position paper in markdown.
  Help the user to “think socratically,” stress-test a thesis, or structure an argument.

This project helps users collect thoughts into cogent **Socratic** arguments—evidence-based position papers that can be as sharp and well-grounded as the best public debaters, without losing intellectual honesty.

**Socratic Hitch** is meant to work like a bicycle for the mind: argumentation and chain-of-thought, pulled forward by structure rather than vibes alone.

# How to debate

> `Hitch` (verb) to move (something) into a different position with a jerk

This skill is a bicycle for the mind on argumentation. Collect thoughts into cogent, evidence-grounded position papers (`SocraticArgument`) that can be shared, refuted, and refined. Aim for clarity and force, not ornament.

## Two modes

| Mode | Use when | Output |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Elenchus** (inquiry) | Thesis or key terms are still vague | Sharp questions that expose hidden premises; no full Argument yet |
| **Argument** (position paper) | User has a stance to document or defend | Markdown `SocraticArgument` per workflow below |

**Pipeline:** messy notes → elenchus on undefined terms → Argument draft → quality pass → file under `docs/<TOPIC>/` if requested.

Default to connected prose in chat. When the user needs a **saved argument**, produce or update Argument markdown.

## Workflow

Do these steps in order. Do not write narrative before definitions for terms that appear in the thesis.

1. **Scope** — One-sentence thesis; name audience and what “success” means (persuade, clarify, archive).
2. **Terms** — List contested words (`ally`, `support`, etc.). Each becomes a `Definition` or `Highlight` before any narrative uses it.
3. **Supporting clauses** — Sub-claims that must hold for the thesis. Per clause: definitions/highlights → narrative only (no main thesis yet).
4. **Main argument** — Single `Clause` that depends on supporting clauses.
5. **Steelman refutations** — Strongest version of opponent claims; attach under the clause or thesis they attack.
6. **Rebuttals** — Your reply to each refutation (nested `Clause` or nested `SocraticArgument` when large).
7. **Open questions** — Explicit unknowns left for elenchus (scoped to undefined terms or evidence gaps).

## Markdown output (maps to schema)

Canonical example: [vibecoding-example.md](./references/vibecoding-example.md).

Optional YAML frontmatter: `title`, `date`, `reply_to`, `author` (or nostr fields).

| Schema field | Markdown section |
|--------------|------------------|
| `SocraticArgument.title` | `# Thesis: …` |
| `abstract` | **Abstract:** paragraph |
| `supporting_clauses[]` | `## Supporting Clause: <title>` |
| `Clause.definitions` | `### Definitions and supporting evidence` |
| `Highlight` | Blockquote + **Source:** citation line |
| `Definition` | `` `Term:` `` definition text; optional inline refutation |
| `Clause.narrative` | `### Narrative` |
| `argument` (main) | `## Argument: <title>` (same subsections as a clause) |
| `refutations` | `## Refutation to: <target> \| Argument: <opponent claim>` then definitions + narrative; nest rebuttals the same way |

**Nesting rules**

- Place refutations **under** the clause or thesis they attack.
- A refutation may be a short pointer (`str`), a full opponent `Clause` (steelman), or a nested `SocraticArgument` for a large counter-position.
- One thesis per file; tangents become supporting clauses or separate Argument files.

Prefer plain headings over HTML color spans on the published site.

## Quality pass (before you ship)

- [ ] Every contested term in the thesis is defined or quoted **before** narrative uses it.
- [ ] Evidence is labeled: **quote/highlight** vs **inference** vs **speculation**.
- [ ] Refutations state the opponent’s claim in words they would accept (steelman).
- [ ] Internal contradictions are named explicitly (e.g. two claims that cannot both hold).
- [ ] Reversibility: would the same principle apply if actors were swapped?
- [ ] One clear thesis; scope matches the user’s actual question.

## Elenchus (when not writing a Argument yet)

Ask questions that stress-test reasoning, not politeness filler:

- What does the central term mean here (and what are plausible alternatives)?
- Against what alternatives is this position measured?
- What moral or historical framework justifies it—and what limits follow?
- What predictable consequences follow—and are they intended?
- Would you hold the same principle if roles were reversed?

Stop when terms and thesis are stable enough for step 1 of the workflow.

## What is a Socratic Argument?

A **SocraticArgument** is a self-contained side in a debate: a `SocraticArgument` made of `Clause` blocks, each with definitions and evidence, each open to refutation. That yields an “arguments all the way down” tree of claim, counterclaim, and reply—**evidence-based reasoning** you can share, attack, and refine.

The normative schema lives in [argument-data-structure.md](./argument-data-structure.md). **Operational instructions** (workflow, markdown mapping, quality checks) are in the skill overview: [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

Arguments are meant to be shared, refuted, researched, and interrogated—so beliefs earn their keep instead of hiding behind slogans.

## Argument data structure (normative schema)

Verbatim from [argument-data-structure.md](./references/argument-data-structure.md). Structure markdown to match these types; implementation in code is optional.
